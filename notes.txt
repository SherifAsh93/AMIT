code contribute: Easy to share ur Code with other, and track changes, who do so for each code

version control (vs): control the whole code, Who Do So and When and in which line of code
Centralized Version Control: For Security Purpose => who will can access the code,
but all developers need to code in the same place (the same lan)

Distriputed Version Control: allow many Developers to work anywhere from any Network, it gives me Backups
Repo = Reposotry => code folder for all projects


git add css/ => to add the whole folder

git commit -m "Dev_Env" => to initializr ur environment locally, after initialization of ur name and email
git config --global user.name "sherif"
git config --global user.email "sherif.ash93@gmail.com"
